// task 26.08.24 

//Create a variable to hold the name of teh student 
//Then create a array of 5 elements to hold the marks of five subjects
//(English Tamil maths science social ) 
//Value of subjects has to be read from the user 
//After getting the marks as input 
//You have to find if the student has passed or not 
//If passed then find the class he cleared 
//Distinction / first class / second class/ third class 
//After this you need to find the eligibility of Student to join Engg Coll 
//Cut off is 180 on adding maths and science 
//find the eligibility of Student to join arts Coll 
//Cut off is 130 on adding social  and science
//If he is eligible for both 
//Then display eligible for both
