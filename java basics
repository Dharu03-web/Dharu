In Java, data types specify the size and type of values that can be stored in variables. Java is a statically-typed language, meaning that variables must be declared with a data type before they can be used. Data types in Java are broadly categorized into two types: **Primitive Data Types** and **Reference/Object Data Types**.

### 1. **Primitive Data Types**

Primitive data types are the most basic data types available in Java. They are predefined by the language and named by a keyword. There are 8 primitive data types in Java:

-


#### Examples of Primitive Data Types:

- **byte:**
  - Size: 1 byte (8 bits)
  - Range: -128 to 127
  - Example:
    ```java
    byte myByte = 100;
    ```

- **short:**
  - Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)
  - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
  - Example:
    ```java
    short myShort = 10000;
    ```

- **int:**
  - Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
  - Range: -2^31 to 2^31-1
  - Example:
    ```java
    int myInt = 100000;
    ```

- **long:**
  - Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
  - Range: -2^63 to 2^63-1
  - Example:
    ```java
    long myLong = 100000L;
    ```

- **float:**
  - Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
  - Range: Approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits)
  - Example:
    ```java
    float myFloat = 10.5f;
    ```

- **double:**
  - Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
  - Range: Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)
  - Example:
    ```java
    double myDouble = 10.5;
    ```

- **char:**
  - Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)
  - Range: 0 to 65,535 (unsigned)
  - Example:
    ```java
    char myChar = 'A';
    ```

- **boolean:**
  - Size: Depends on the JVM (typically 1 bit is used)
  - Values: `true` or `false`
  - Example:
    ```java
    boolean myBoolean = true;
    ```

### 2. **Reference/Object Data Types**

Reference data types are not predefined like primitive types. They are created using class definitions. These include classes, arrays, and interfaces. Reference variables are used to store the memory address of an object.

#### Examples of Reference Data Types:

- **String:**
  - Example:
    ```java
    String myString = "Hello, World!";
    ```

- 
### **Summary**
- **Primitive Data Types**: Directly hold the values. Examples include `int`, `char`, `float`, etc.
- **Reference Data Types**: Hold references (addresses) to objects. Examples include `String`, arrays, classes, and interfaces.
